# city-bike-API


### Description 
The project involved creating a modal to add to the main webpage of city-scapes.  Following the initial idea, an API was selected was from a  small company city-bikes having wide-ranging data, collecting from a network thoroughout the world.  It used RAPID API and was free to get a key.  Successfully, the javascript code brought the objects into the console but was difficult to attribute to the text of the modal.  The project is a work in progress and for the future will be able to put this into the modal and have it linked through the main website to get facts and city bike locations, and ultimately, provide useful information like the url of the site, how many bikes there are, the city, idx, if free, the types of bikes, coordinates of the depo, and the station url.  This project was enlightening of how an API works.  Please visit again soon!
